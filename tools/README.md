# Analysis tools for cube recon

This is a library of tools to be used to help analyzed the output of
the cubeRecon.  It needs the cuberecon_io library, but doesn't depend
on the actual reconstruction source code.  It is intended to be used
outside of the CubeRecon package.  Note that the actual CubeRecon
library MUST NOT DEPEND ON THIS CODE.  Most of the utilities in this
code are about reading the truth information!  DO NOT LINK TO THIS IN
CubeRecon.
